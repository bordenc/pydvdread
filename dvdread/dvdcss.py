"""
ctypes wrapper to VideoLAN's libdvdcss API header files.

These are low-level wrappers. For most purposes, you want to use the module's
DVD class instead. Refer to the C header documentation, such as it is, for
usage information.

The wrappers try to appear in the same order as the original header file. This
module wraps definitions from outside the libdvdcss API where those definitions
are necessary to complete a function prototype. Further, wrappers will appear
out of order from the header file when this module needs to define something
before defining something else. Python doesn't have forward declarations to
allow the original ordering.

libdvdread handles CSS scrambling, which may be illegal in your jurisdiction.
This is offered for completeness. It does not yet control for the library not
being installed.
